This project deep dive into Doubly linked lists in C Programming. The prototypes of all the file functions are stored in this lists.h file. The file programs are executed thus;

0 - Writes a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list. 1 - Writes a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list. 2 - Writes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list. 3 - Writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list. 4 - Writes a function that frees a dlistint_t list. 5 - Writes a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list. 6 - Writes a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list. 7 - Writes a function that inserts a new node at a given position. 8 - Writes a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.

100 - Find the password for crackme4.

Save the password in the file 100-password
The file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
Hint: The program prints “OK” when the password is correct.
102 - A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
Save the result in the file 102-result.
103 - Writes a keygen for crackme5.

Usage of the crackme: ./crackme5 username key
The crackme will segfault if you do not enter the correct key for the user
Usage for the keygen: ./keygen5 username
The keygen should print a valid key for the username.
